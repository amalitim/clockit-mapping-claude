Build a Local Windows App for Task “Type” Classification & Review
Goal

Create a fully local Windows-friendly Python application that:

1. reads the data in the folder /training-data or accepts a file upload.

2. trains a multi-class classifier to predict the Type column from the other columns except Source.Name,

serves a simple web UI to visualize word/phrase–to–class relationships,

3. lets me upload new CSVs (without Type) for prediction, review/override results inline, and

4. download the final CSV with Type appended.

5. Everything must run offline on Windows 10/11. (e.g via web browser)
